- **label** (optional): Ground truth labels for evaluation (0=normal, 1=threat)

Example:
```csv
timestamp,bytes_sent,bytes_received,packets,duration,port,protocol,label
2024-10-20 14:23:45,1024,2048,50,10.5,443,HTTPS,0
2024-10-20 14:23:50,50000,100000,500,1.2,4444,TCP,1
```

### Anomaly Detection Pipeline

1. **Data Loading**: Parse and validate network log entries
2. **Temporal Feature Engineering**: Extract time-based patterns
3. **Preprocessing**: Scale features and encode categorical variables
4. **PCA Application**: Reduce dimensionality while preserving variance
5. **Isolation Forest Training**: Identify anomalous patterns
6. **Risk Scoring**: Calculate normalized risk scores (0-100)
7. **Alert Generation**: Flag high-risk activities for investigation

### Engineered Features

**Temporal Features:**

### Risk Classification

- **Low Risk** (0-30): Normal activity
- **Medium Risk** (30-60): Slightly suspicious
- **High Risk** (60-85): Investigation recommended
- **Critical Risk** (85-100): Immediate action required

## 📊 Dashboard Visualizations

The system generates a comprehensive 7-panel dashboard:

1. **Risk Score Distribution**: Histogram of all risk scores
2. **Risk Level Breakdown**: Pie chart of risk categories
3. **Temporal Threat Pattern**: Threats by hour of day

## 🎨 Customization

### Adjust Detection Sensitivity

- **Security Operations Centers (SOC)**: Threat intelligence dashboard
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Log analysis for security audits
- **Incident Response**: Identify and investigate suspicious activities

## 🔍 Feature Engineering Details

### Why Temporal Features?

Attack patterns often follow time-based trends:
- **DDoS attacks**: Often during business hours for maximum impact
- **Data exfiltration**: Frequently during off-hours to avoid detection
- **Port scans**: May follow regular patterns or avoid peak times

### PCA Benefits

- Reduces computational complexity
- Removes correlated features
- Preserves most important variance
- Improves Isolation Forest performance

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue**: High false positive rate
- **Solution**: Decrease contamination parameter (e.g., 0.02) or increase alert threshold

**Issue**: Missing threats
- **Solution**: Increase contamination parameter (e.g., 0.10) or lower alert threshold

**Issue**: Memory errors with large datasets
- **Solution**: Process logs in batches or reduce n_estimators in Isolation Forest

**Issue**: Slow processing
- **Solution**: Reduce PCA components or use subset of features

## 📚 Algorithm Details

### Isolation Forest

Isolation Forest works by:
1. Randomly selecting a feature
2. Randomly selecting a split value between min and max
3. Recursively partitioning the data
4. Anomalies require fewer splits to isolate

**Why it works for cyber threats:**
- Attacks have unusual feature combinations
- Anomalies are "easier to isolate" than normal traffic
- Scales well to large datasets

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA transforms correlated features into orthogonal components:
- Reduces dimensionality while preserving variance
- Speeds up anomaly detection
- Visualizes threat separation in 2D space
